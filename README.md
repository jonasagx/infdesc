An Infinite Descent into Pure Mathematics
=========================================

This Git repository contains the TeX source for _An Infinite Descent into Pure Mathematics_ by Clive Newstead.

The main website for the book is [here](https://infinitedescent.xyz/).

## Nevegando o codigo

To compile the source, you will need a LaTeX implementation on your computer, or a browser-based LaTeX editor such as [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), using the compiler pdfLaTeX.

The root document is `infdesc.tex`, which calls all the other files it needs to compile the document.

The `book` folder contains the bulk of the actual content of the book, and is fairly easy to navigate. For example, to find the source for Section 5.2 (_Equivalence relations_) in Chapter 5 (_Relations_), navigate to `book/relations/equivalence-relations.tex`.

The `book/includes` folder contains all the code used for calling packages, taking care of formatting, custom commands and environments, and so on.
